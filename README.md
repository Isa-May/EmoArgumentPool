This is a basic django REST Api allowing to display arguments classified as 'emotional' and 'non-emotional'
by the machine learning models created in my project https://github.com/Isa-May/EmotionalArgumentationProject. An 'emotional' argument, as classified in this work, is an argument containing pathos, i.e. emotional appeal. A 'non-emotional' argument is, by contrast, not able to trigger emotions. 


Please note that the arguments are by no means selected to reflect my personal views nor are they directed towards anyone, they are simply the outcome of a research project. The sources of the data are mainly from online arguments portals and forums where people 
give their views on topics as presented in the API. - The exact sources are:
